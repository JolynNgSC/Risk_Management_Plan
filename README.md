# Risk Management Plan
In this collaborative project, I assumed the role of team leader, responsible for coordinating group efforts, ensuring comprehensive gathering of all necessary components, and overseeing the project's overall progress to ensure its successful completion.

Within the framework of our group project, we discerned three distinct categories of risks: Human Resources, Physical Resources, and Processes and Procedures, each representing key areas susceptible to potential vulnerabilities and challenges. Alongside each identified risk, we have included corresponding countermeasures. Additionally, we conducted risk assesments to these identified risks. 

Through this project, I learned about risk management, cost-benefit analysis, as well as different assets. This allows me to understand the overall structure and planning for an organization before they start implementation.

### Group work
